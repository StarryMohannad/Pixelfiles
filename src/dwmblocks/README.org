* Config
here is the config file for dwmblocks, I wrote it in org mode to document it, to apply changes press (Ctrl+c Ctrl+v t)

** Blocks
these are the blocks that appear on the status bar
they use scripts placed in ~/.local/share/dwm/blocks

| Block    | Script | Icon |
|----------+--------+------|
| Music    | mus    |     |
| Battary  | bat    | 󱐋    |
| Volume   | vol    | 󰕾    |
| Weather  | wtr    | ---- |
| Calender | cal    | 󰸗    |
| Clock    | tim    |     |

#+BEGIN_SRC C
static const Block blocks[] = {
{ "  ", "~/.local/share/dwm/blocks/mus", 1, 0},
{ "󱐋  ", "~/.local/share/dwm/blocks/bat", 1, 0},
{ "󰕾  ", "~/.local/share/dwm/blocks/vol", 1, 0},
{ "",    "~/.local/share/dwm/blocks/wtr", 1, 0},
{ "󰸗  ", "~/.local/share/dwm/blocks/cal", 1, 0},
{ "  ", "~/.local/share/dwm/blocks/tim", 1, 0}, };
#+END_SRC

** Delimiter
this is the delimiter that appears between blocks

| Varible  | Purpose                                      |
|----------+----------------------------------------------|
| delim    | the character that will act as the delimiter |
| delimLen | the length of the delimiter                  |

#+BEGIN_SRC C
static char delim[] = " | ";
static unsigned int delimLen = 5;
#+END_SRC
